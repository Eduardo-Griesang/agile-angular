# Agile Test

This is an Angular project created to resolve a Technical Interview question part of the third step of Agile's hiring process

## How it works

The way that I made this project work was by creating a menu with a cascading system of select tags, meaning that depending on witch option we chose to select on the first "select" tag we'll have different options for the second and third "select" tags. You can test it yourself by cloning this repository and running it locally on your computer.
